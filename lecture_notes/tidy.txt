Tip: before you move on and discover how to load your data into R, it might be useful to go over the following checklist that will make it easier to import the data correctly into R:

If you work with spreadsheets, the first row is usually reserved for the header, while the first column is used to identify the sampling unit;
Avoid names, values or fields with blank spaces, otherwise each word will be interpreted as a separate variable, resulting in errors that are related to the number of elements per line in your data set;
If you want to concatenate words, inserting a . in between to words instead of a space;
Short names are prefered over longer names;
Try to avoid using names that contain symbols such as ?, $,%, ^, &, *, (, ),-,#, ?,,,<,>, /, |, , [ ,] ,{, and };
Delete any comments that you have made in your Excel file to avoid extra columns or NA’s to be added to your file; and
Make sure that any missing values in your data set are indicated with NA.

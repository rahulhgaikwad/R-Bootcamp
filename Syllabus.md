### Time Commitment
This is a fast paced 1 unit course conducted over 3 weeks. Learning a programming language is not trivial, expect to spend around hours per week for these three weeks if you have never programmed before. 

### Prerequisites
* Basic computer literacy. 
* ELM status. 

### Materials

* Textbook: None Required. 
* Good online resources that I recommmend to bookmark are: 
    - [R Tutorial](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction)
    - [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/index.html)
    - [R-Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)
    - [Workshop for Python coders by Ramnath Vaidyanathan](https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/)
* Computer: Mandatory. A reliable laptop that you can install programs onto. See me if you do not have a personal computer. 
* Reliable internet connection.

### Grading
Credit / No Credit. There are 40 points possible will be gained by participating in the discussion forum (4), completing each swirl lesson (4 total), two quizes (6 each) and final project (20). Achieving 70% or higher (28 points) is needed to earn credit.
